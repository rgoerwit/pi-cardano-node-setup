## Synopsis

**pi-cardano-setup.sh**:  Bash script that installs a Cardano relay node on a Raspberry Pi 4 running 64-bit aarch64 Ubuntu LTS

Obtain:  git clone https://github.com/rgoerwit/pi-cardano-node-setup/

Run:  cd pi-cardano-node-setup/scripts; bash ./pi-cardano-setup.sh ... 

Assumes:  Relays will be on ports 300x, block producers on ports 600x
## Example Invocations

**New overclocking (-o 2100) ARM-based mainnet relay setup on TCP port 3000 (-p 3000), with VLAN 5 setup (-v 5); ssh allowed from 192.168.1.0/24 and 10.5.0.0/16 (-s ...)**:
```
pi-cardano-setup.sh -D -b builduser -u cardano -n mainnet -v 5 -s '192.168.1.0/24,10.5.0.0/16' -o 2100 -p 3000 
```
**New overclocking (-o 2100) ARM-based mainnet block producer setup on TCP port 6000, with VLAN 10 setup (-v 10), with two relay nodes (-R ...); ssh allowed from 192.168.1.0/24 and 10.5.0.0/16 (-s ...)**:  
```
pi-cardano-setup.sh -D -b builduser -u cardano -n mainnet -v 10 -s '192.168.1.0/24,10.5.0.0/16' -o 2100 -p 6000 -R '192.168.6.208:3000,192.168.6.209:3000
```
**Same as previous, but using specific cardano-node version 1.26.1 (normally we just default to the latest numbered version)**:
```
pi-cardano-setup.sh -D -b builduser -u cardano -n mainnet -v 10 -s '192.168.1.0/24,10.5.0.0/16' -o 2100 -p 6000 -R '192.168.6.208:3000,192.168.6.209:3000 -V '1.26.1'
```
**New (non-ARM; -G ' ') mainnet relay setup on TCP port 3000, with no firewall configuration (-S)**:
```
pi-cardano-node-setup.sh -D -b builduser -u cardano -n mainnet -p 3000 -S -G ' '
```
**Refresh of existing mainnet block producer setup with full recompile, keeping existing config files (-d), but using just a single relay, 192.168.6.238:3000; ssh allowed only from 10.100.6.0/24 (-s ...)**:  
```
pi-cardano-setup.sh -D -b builduser -u cardano -n mainnet -p 6000 -d -s '10.100.6.0/24' -R '192.168.6.238:3000'
```
**Refresh of existing mainnet block producer setup *without* full recompile (-x), keeping existing config files (-d), but using just a single relay, 192.168.6.238:3000; ssh allowed only from 10.100.6.0/24 (-s ...)**:  
```
pi-cardano-setup.sh -D -b builduser -u cardano -n mainnet -p 6000 -x -d -s '10.100.6.0/24' -R '192.168.6.238:3000'
```

## Command-line syntax is as follows:

```
Usage: pi-cardano-node-setup [-4 <bind IPv4>] [-6 <bind IPv6>] [-b <builduser>] [-B <guild repo branch name>] [-c <node config filename>] \
    [-C <cabal version>] [-d] [-D] [-f <parent:port>] [-F <hostname>] [-g <GHC-OS>] [-G <GCC-arch] [-h <SID:password>] [-H] [-i] [-m <seconds>] \
	[-n <mainnet|testnet|launchpad|guild|staging>] [-N] [-o <overclock speed>] [-p <port>] [-P <pool name>] [-r]  [-R <node-ip:port>] \
	[-s <subnet>] [-S] [-u <installuser>] [-w <libsodium-version-number>] [-U <cardano-node branch>] [-v <VLAN num> ] \
	[-V <cardano-node version>] [-w <libsodium-version>] [-w <cnode-script-version>] [-x] [-y <ghc-version>] [-Y]
```

Argument explanation:

```
-4    Bind IPv4 address (defaults to 0.0.0.0)
-6    Bind IPv6 address (defaults to NULL)
-b    User whose home directory will be used for compiling (defaults to 'builduser')
-B    Branch to use when checking out SPO Guild repo code (defaults to 'master')
-c    Node configuration file (defaults to <install user home dir>/<network>-config.json)
-C    Specific cabal version to use
-d    Don't overwrite config files, or 'env' file for gLiveView
-D    Emit chatty debugging output about what the program is doing
-f    Configure as a warm-spare failover for server <parent:port> (may be a DNS name or IP address)
-F    Force <hostname> as external DNS name (mainly relevant if using hosted Grafana and you're on dynamic DNS)
-g    GHC operating system (defaults to deb10; could also be deb9, centos7, etc.)
-G    GHC gcc architecture (default is -march=Armv8-A); the value here is in the form of a flag supplied to GCC
-y    GHC version (currently defaults to 8.10.4)
-h    Install (naturally, hidden) WiFi; format: SID:password (only use WiFi on the relay, not block producer)
-H    Hosted Grafana - allow appropriate access to Prometheus port (may require further ACLs or port forwarding)
-i    Ignore missing dependencies installed by apt-get
-l    Print command-line used for last run and exit
-m    Maximum time in seconds that you allow the file download operation to take before aborting (Default: 80s)
-n    Connect to specified network instead of mainnet network (Default: mainnet)
      e.g.: -n testnet (alternatives: allegra launchpad mainnet mary_qa shelley_qa staging testnet...)
-N    No startup - don't start cardano-node or other services (used for backups to /dev/sda...)
-o    Overclocking value (should be something like, e.g., 2100 for a Pi 4 - with heat sinks and a fan, should be fine)
-p    Listen port (default 3000); assumes we are a block producer if <port> is >= 6000
-P    Pool name (not ticker - useful if using CNTools to create wallets inside <INSTALLDIR>/priv/pool)
-r    Install RDP
-R    Nodes (ip-address:port[,ip-address:port...]) to add to topology.json file (to point relays at BP and vice versa)
-s    Networks to allow SSH from (comma-separated, CIDR)
-S    Skip firewall configuration
-u    User who will run the executables and in whose home directory the executables will be installed
-U    Specify Cardano branch to check out (goes with -V <version>; usually the value will be 'master' or 'bench')
-w    Specify a libsodium version (defaults to the wacky version the Cardano project recommends)
-W    Specify a Guild CNode Tool version (defaults to the latest)
-v    Enable vlan <number> on eth0; DHCP to that VLAN; disable eth0 interface
-V    Specify Cardano node version (for example, 1.25.1; defaults to a recent, stable version); compare -U <branch>
-x    Don't recompile anything big, like ghc, libsodium, and cardano-node
-Y    Set up cardano-db-sync
```

## Motivation

This script solves a practical problem.

ARM processor-based systems are not well supported in the Cardano world, and the Pi 4 is in particular not well supported.

pi-cardano-setup.sh not only gets the operating system ready, installing all the basic prereqs, but it also actually builds and configures a generic Cardano node.

It is a distillation of many sets of available directions, including:

## Installation

Simply copy pi-cardano-setup.sh (and optionally pi-cardano-fake-code.sh) onto a fresh Pi 4 running 64-bit aarch64 Ubuntu LTS and execute it.

It may be run subsequently with the -d argument to refresh executables, but leave configuration files untouched.


## Tests

There are no regression tests for this script.  Please do not run it on an already-configured relay that's been lovingly hand crafted and configured.  It may overwrite your work if you're not careful.

This script is intended for situations where you want a generic, working relay up fast.  ("Fast" by Pi standards, that is.)
